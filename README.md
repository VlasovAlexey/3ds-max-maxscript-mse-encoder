29 May 2015 - 0.6.4     encryption PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC, BytesToKey and ZIP_AES (now zip.bms supports AES too), updated many compression algorithms (LZ4 was necessary for Witcher3), small fix for unzip_dynamic/bzip2

01 May 2015 - 0.6.3     new Codepage command for utf16 to utf8 strings conversion (will be improved/expanded in future), base conversion in Math command (binary/octal), fix for the parameters in the Print command after the pipe, many new compression algorithms including also recompression (cpk, bpe and nrv are the most important), new argument for Strlen to get the full size of the variable, initial implementation of rsa encryption, command Append 1 improved to work with Goto, additional parameter in xor_prev/next to specify the operation on the last byte, fixed a bug in CallDLL introduced in the last version, QuickBMS version and information visible in the properties of the exe, restored compatibility with Windows 98 (_fstat64 caused by <iostream>)

01 Apr 2015 - 0.6.2     tons of new compression algorithms, new Makefile for Linux, calldll from encryption/comtype with #INPUT_SIZE# and #OUTPUT_SIZE#, String with multiplication and hex2uri/uri2hex operators, a '0' added to the String operator allows to set an empty VAR1 in case of errors, rc6 encryption, xor_prev/xor_prev2/xor_next/xor_next2 encryptions, fix for getarray, added adler32 to the available crc functions, fix for a rare bug in reimporting, append 1 now allows to place the new content at the current position of the output file, source code of QuickBMS in a separate zip archive to avoid space and confusion, fix for using libtomcrypt, activated all the rnc compressions available, fix for xmemdecompress of native files (0xed magic), cleaning of spaces at the end of folder names in extraction, fix for filepath type

07 Dec 2014 - 0.6.1     most of the global variables now have a g_ prefix, new NameCRC instruction for working with list of filenames, support for full scripts passed as command-line argument (';' separated), support for C NULL delimited arrays like short var[], many new crc/hash algorithms for the encryption and namecrc commands, added basename/filepath/filename comparisons for conditions, fix for math x with big numbers, added Set filepath, String P mode to use the same syntax of the Print command, enhancement of the Comtype dictionary to allow data containing zeroes, added new compression and recompression algorithms, mpq encryption, fix for the prs compression, more information when a read and compression error occurs, option -M for extracting only the files different than those available in another folder, no folders creation with -0 and -O, QUICKBMS_FILENAME internal variable, updated some libraries, zlib_noerror and deflate_noerror automatically increase the uncompressed size if needed (they use the same code of unzip_dynamic), Xmemdecompress with automatic decompression of Xbox files compressed with xbcompress (lzxdecode and lzxnative), lzma_dynamic with automatic scanning of the flags in case of failure, small fix for some gzip files, other small fixes and improvements, support for C enum, idstring information in -V mode, visualization of the last script line that caused the error, updated some libraries like lzma

25 Jul 2014 - 0.6       review and better writing of quickbms.txt, source code extension H to C, -a can be specified multiple times for new arguments, new argument for the Append command to choose when and how write the new data, added new names for String operators, Endian can save the current endianess in a variable, Get line works even if there is no new line delimiter at end of file, last offset visualized when a compression fails, additional arguments for String printf, fix for base64_compress that wasn't handled, added comtype lz4_compress, new behavior of Debug command, base_offset argument for Padding command, negative index variable for get/putarray for taking and storing elements at the end of array, a positive value in goto SEEK_END is automatically converted in negative to seek correctly, fix for the filenames ending with . or * to guess their extension, better colors for the hexhtml visualization, automatic handling of xcompressed files (\x0F\xF5\x12\xEE) in comtype xmemcompress, some malloc to calloc changes, new icon, changed major version number due to the huge amount of enhancements from 0.5

01 Jul 2011 - 0.5.2     finally an homepage for this project, many fixes and additions some of which are time, time64, clsid, ipv4, ipv6, assembly types (yes now it can be used as a quick assembler/disassembler), rotate, reverse and pc1 encryption, msf compression, new experimental input and outputs with SSL added to the socket interface, the -H option for a html output of the parsed file format and much more

08 Jun 2011 - 0.5.1     updated the supported calling conventions, added experimental support for network sockets and processes, various fixes for the write operations, added rotate encryption and a new useless option for the math one
31 May 2011 - 0.5       updated some libraries, added libkirk and nitrosdk, incremental xor and rot encryptions, aes ctr, added the new types: float, double, variable, variable2 and variant, new cool debug mode, various fixes, allowed the reimporting of nameless files (like 00000000.dat), experimental parsing of C structures, handling of multiline comments, added falcom recompression and dragonballz decompression

11 Mar 2011 - 0.4.10b   fixed a bug in quickbms64_test

10 Mar 2011 - 0.4.10a   fixed a small problem of the reimport mode happening in some rare cases when encryption is used
12 Apr 2010 - 0.4       automatic folder and extensions when it's used no filename in the *log commands, reintroduced all the openssl algorithms manually, fixed and enhanced some features of CallDll, changed the behaviour of lzhuf (it took the decompressed size from the data), improved handling of less known gz/z files, added the pack compression, note: remember to check ever the list of available scripts because I update and write new ones often, for example majesty2.bms is now complete and compatible with any version


28 Sep 2009 - 0.3       added documentation, added xor, rot and charset as parts of the Encryption command, now the input can be both an archive and a folder containing more archives

27 May 2009 - 0.2.1     fixed the handling of some numbers (signed integers and shifting are not friends), the letters between ' are now considered numbers (so 'a' is 0x61), now in Get/PutVarChr is possible to specify also the size of the number through an optional parameter and added: LZX, Binary and BaseName types, BytesRead and NotEOF internal variables (they are used in MultiEx), handling of elif and else (very useful), a new optional parameter in FindLoc to avoid to terminate the script if the string is not found, various new String operators, GetArray and PutArray functions which can be used to work on some temporary dynamic arrays (useful in some occasions), QuickBMSver command which allows to specify the minimum version of QuickBMS supported by that script

25 Apr 2009 - 0.1.4     this tool is a scripts based files extractor compatible with the BMS language. the idea was born from the need of a simple and fast solution for handling the simple types of archives used by the majority of games without losing time writing a stand-alone tool with tons of C code just for a basic file format
